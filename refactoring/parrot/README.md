# Parrot Refactoring Kata

Refactor code using Polymorphism. The kata is fully functional with a complete test suite. Your objective is to improve the code while keeping all tests passing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

Run the project in a Docker container with zero PHP setup required.

#### Run Tests Once

To run the complete test suite automatically:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will install dependencies and run all tests. The container exits after completion.

#### Run Individual Commands

To keep the container running and execute commands repeatedly, use the `-d` flag:

```bash
# Start the container in the background
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
docker-compose exec parrot-refactoring composer test

# Stop the container when done
docker-compose down
```

Alternatively, use the container name directly:

```bash
docker exec ipc26-parrot composer test
```

### Option 2: Local PHP Setup

Requires:

- PHP 8.4+
- Composer

Install dependencies and run tests:

```bash
composer install
composer test
```
