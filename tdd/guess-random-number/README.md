# Guess Random Number TDD Kata

Practice Test-Driven Development by building a guessing game. Control randomness with mocks/stubs, cover edge cases, and separate logic from I/O for easier testing.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

Run the project in a Docker container with zero PHP setup required.

#### Run Tests Once

To run the complete test suite automatically:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will install dependencies and run all tests. The container exits after completion.

#### Run Individual Commands

To keep the container running and execute commands repeatedly, use the `-d` flag:

```bash
# Start the container in the background
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
docker-compose exec guess-number-tdd composer test

# Stop the container when done
docker-compose down
```

### Option 2: Local PHP Setup

Requires:

- PHP 8.4+
- Composer

Install dependencies and run tests:

```bash
composer install
composer test
```

## About This Kata

### Problem Statement

Build a simple game where a player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The player has **3 attempts**. After each guess, the system tells the player if the correct number is higher or lower. If the player guesses correctly, they win; otherwise, they lose.

### Business Rules

- A random number is generated at the beginning of the game and **remains constant** until the game ends
- The player gets max **three attempts** to guess the number
- If the guess is correct: the player **wins**
- If the guess is incorrect: the game tells the player if the correct number is **higher or lower**
- If the player uses all 3 attempts unsuccessfully, they **lose**

### Use Cases

**1. Player wins on the first guess**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(5));
echo $game->guessNumber(5); // "You win!"
```

**2. Player wins after multiple guesses**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(5));
echo $game->guessNumber(10); // "Lower"
echo $game->guessNumber(3);  // "Higher"
echo $game->guessNumber(5);  // "You win!"
```

**3. Player loses**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(5));
echo $game->guessNumber(1);  // "Higher"
echo $game->guessNumber(10); // "Lower"
echo $game->guessNumber(3);  // "You lose! The number was 5"
```

### Suggested Class API

```php
interface RandomNumberGenerator {
    public function generate(): int;
}

final class GuessingNumberGame
{
    public function __construct(private RandomNumberGenerator $generator) {}

    public function guessNumber(int $n): string {}
}
```

### TDD Plan

**Test 1: Win on first try**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(5));
assert($game->guessNumber(5) === "You win!");
```

**Test 2: Hint "higher" and "lower"**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(7));
assert($game->guessNumber(4) === "Higher");
assert($game->guessNumber(9) === "Lower");
```

**Test 3: Win on last attempt**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(7));
$game->guessNumber(3);
$game->guessNumber(6);
assert($game->guessNumber(7) === "You win!");
```

**Test 4: Lose after 3 wrong attempts**
```php
$game = new GuessingNumberGame(new StubGenerator(5));
$game->guessNumber(1);
$game->guessNumber(2);
assert($game->guessNumber(3) === "You lose! The number was 5");
```

### Implementation Tips

- Track the number of attempts left
- Lock in the generated number on instantiation
- Return messages from `guessNumber()` method
- Use dependency injection for `RandomNumberGenerator` in tests

### Things to Avoid

- Re-generating the random number on every guess
- Exposing internal state
- Mixing logic and presentation

### Concepts Practiced

- Test Doubles / Mocking
- Baby steps & micro-iterations
- Object Calisthenics
- Primitive Obsession elimination

### Bonus Challenges

- Extend the range (e.g., 1–100)
- Make number of attempts configurable
- Add user interaction (via CLI or Web)
