# Rock Paper Scissors TDD Kata

Practice Test-Driven Development by building a rock-paper-scissors game. Define rules and logic clearly with tests, covering all outcomes efficiently using parameterized tests.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

Run the project in a Docker container with zero PHP setup required.

#### Run Tests Once

To run the complete test suite automatically:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will install dependencies and run all tests. The container exits after completion.

#### Run Individual Commands

To keep the container running and execute commands repeatedly, use the `-d` flag:

```bash
# Start the container in the background
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
docker-compose exec rock-paper-scissors-tdd composer test

# Stop the container when done
docker-compose down
```

### Option 2: Local PHP Setup

Requires:

- PHP 8.4+
- Composer

Install dependencies and run tests:

```bash
composer install
composer test
```
